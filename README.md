Project Overview:
This is a responsive travel website designed using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5. The website includes key sections such as a navigation bar, a carousel hero section, travel packages, an about section, a contact form, and a footer with social links and a newsletter subscription form. The overall design prioritizes a clean, modern look with user-friendly features, leveraging Bootstrap components for responsiveness and styling.

Design Choices:
Color Scheme:

The primary color theme is yellow (#f0ad4e), complemented by light gray and dark gray shades for backgrounds, text, and accents. The color scheme reflects a warm, adventurous feeling, suitable for a travel website.
Typography:

Custom fonts are used for the headings, specifically "Nothing You Could Do", a cursive style from Google Fonts. This adds a personal, unique touch to the site. Standard sans-serif fonts are used for body text for clarity and readability.
Layout:

A fixed top navigation bar allows easy access to different sections of the page, even as users scroll.
The content is divided into cards for each travel package, each card showcasing an image, title, description, and a call-to-action button ("Book Now").
The sections are laid out in a responsive grid using Bootstrap's grid system. The page adapts to different screen sizes using container and row classes.
Images and Carousel:

The carousel in the hero section provides a visually dynamic introduction to the site, showcasing different travel destinations with images and overlay captions. Each slide is equipped with a call-to-action button ("Explore Now") that links to the travel packages section.
The carousel automatically transitions between images with a 5-second interval, but users can also manually navigate between slides.
Cards for Travel Packages:

Travel packages are displayed in responsive Bootstrap cards that adjust based on screen size. Each card includes an image, title, brief description, and a "Book Now" button. The use of shadow-lg class adds a soft shadow for better visual hierarchy.
Unique Bootstrap Features Implemented:
Navbar:

The navbar is created using Bootstrap’s navbar-expand-md class to make it responsive. It collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens, ensuring the layout remains usable on mobile devices.
The navbar also includes a search bar, allowing users to search for specific content directly from the navigation.
Carousel:

The carousel in the hero section uses the carousel, carousel-inner, and carousel-item classes from Bootstrap to manage image slides and captions.
The carousel indicators (button elements with data-bs-target) allow users to manually select the slide they want to view.
Autoplay and manual navigation are enabled with Bootstrap’s built-in classes for controlling carousel behavior.
Cards for Packages:

Each travel package is placed in a Bootstrap card which automatically adjusts its layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views. The cards utilize the shadow-lg class for depth, and the btn btn-warning class for the action buttons ensures a cohesive look with the site’s color scheme.
The use of col-md-4 and col-lg-3 ensures that the cards are properly aligned and spaced on all screen sizes.
Form Components:

The contact form utilizes Bootstrap’s form-floating classes for a clean and modern input field design. Each field has a floating label, and the form is styled to be fully responsive.
The form also includes a submit button with a hover effect (btn btn-warning), maintaining the site's color consistency.
Footer:

The footer is designed with a 3-column layout using Bootstrap’s grid system. It includes a company logo, quick links, social media links, and a newsletter subscription form.
The social media icons are added using Font Awesome icons and are styled for easy accessibility.
Responsive Design:

The website is fully responsive, thanks to Bootstrap's mobile-first grid system, with media queries that adapt the layout to different screen sizes.
Columns automatically collapse and stack on smaller devices, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
